# Notice if we were not allowed to include cycles
# in the path (i.e: the path must be simple),
# then the problem would be NP-complete
# as there is a Hamiltonian path reduction to this
# problem

# We can create a tree of possibilities of depth
# K, however the tree grows exponentially O(E^K)
# (thanks to cycles), then find the shortest path.

# There is a simple solution using Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm.
#
# Notice all weights are negative, so we don't worry about
# negative cycles. Otherwise, we would have to run a full
# bellman-ford, store the path when we reach K+1, and keep
# going to complete it and check if there is a (negative) cycle in the
# last iteration
#
# ^ this finds a path of *at most* K edges, not *exactly* K edges,
# that can only be done by pruning the tree, instead of storing
# every possible path, which requires dynamic programming (next chapter)
