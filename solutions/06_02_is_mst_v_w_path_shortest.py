# No. See Figure 6.3 for a counter example.
# The path from B to E is 7 in the MST

# A MST is the subset of a graph forming
# a tree whose sum of edge weights is
# as small as possible. That does not mean
# the path from 2 arbitrary vertices will
# be the minimal possible path. In fact,
# a graph can contain multiple different
# MSTs.
