# No. Counter example for both points:
# Shortest path A-2-C-2-B; A-6-D; total weight 10
# and
# MST A-5-B; B-2-C; B-2-D; total weight 9
#
# The path between A and any vertex in the MST
# is not the shortest.
#
# ^ this is the graph from 06_16 point 3 but undirected

# For a graph with multiple MSTs see Figure 6.3
# for a counter example for point 1
