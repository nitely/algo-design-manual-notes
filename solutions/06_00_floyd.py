# Floyd finds all-pairs shortest path
# ie: the shortest path from any vertex
# to any vertex.
# However, the returned matrix here, can
# only be used to know the distance between
# any pair of vertices, not the path.
#
# Notice the diagonal of the matrix is 0
# since distance from a given vertex to the same
# vertex is 0. If it's less than 0, then there's
# at least one negative weight cycle in that vertex, if this
# happen then we can't get distance between vertices
# in the cycle. Floyd can detect there is at least one
# negative cycle, but it can't list them all.

# runtime O(nÂ³)
