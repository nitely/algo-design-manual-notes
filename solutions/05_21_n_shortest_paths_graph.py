# note: "Vertex disjoint" path means a path with no common internal vertex
# ie: vertex disjoint
# s -> a -> b -> c -> d
# s -> x -> y -> z -> d
# not vertex disjoint (a is common)
# s -> a -> b -> c -> d
# s -> x -> a -> z -> d

# We can assume the (sub-)graph from
# v to w is connected since there should
# be a path. If there is not, then we
# don't care if it's disconnected or
# just missing

# As soon as we reach w, we check

# A given vertex can be visited multiple

#
# XXX We must avoid loops and visiting an edge multiple times,
# which would make this O(VÂ² + EÂ²). This solution does a poor
# job at that, it only avoids self-loops and loops that lead to longer paths.
# We should add a counter to the queue items of repeated vertices per
# level, i.e: pop all items of a level and then go through all the
# edges and count repeated ones to avoid adding them to the queue.
# It seems hard to come up with a quadratic example that does not involve
# self-loops or loops with longer paths, though.
