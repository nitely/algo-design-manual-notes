# I don't think we can do better,
# This is very much like a BFS,
# visit all vertex, for each one
# visit their edges, for each one
# visit their edges. Using BFS directly
# would take doing BFS for each vertex
# (they may all be disconnected),
# BFS is O(V+E) but only if we avoid
# visiting the vertices and edges multiple times,
# which can't be done here
